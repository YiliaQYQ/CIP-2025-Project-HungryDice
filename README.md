# CIP-2025-Project-HungryDice
📌 Program Description
FoodiePick (or your chosen name) is a simple and fun restaurant recommendation tool that helps you decide what to eat based on your favorite food styles.

You can:

🍜 Add restaurants under different cuisines or styles (e.g., Japanese, Mexican, Korean BBQ)

🎲 Get a random suggestion based on the style you're craving

💾 Save your favorite places, so they're always ready when you're hungry and indecisive!

It's perfect for foodies who:

Want to track favorite spots by cuisine

Often ask "What should I eat today?"

Enjoy a little randomness in their food adventures

No more endless scrolling or decision fatigue — just input your mood, and let the app do the choosing!
